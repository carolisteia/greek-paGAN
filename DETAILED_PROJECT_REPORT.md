## Comprehensive Report on the Notebooks:

### Introduction
The project is focused on employing machine learning techniques to identify and generate ancient Greek characters. It is structured around several key activities, including dataset preparation, model training, and evaluation of generative models. The overarching goal is to explore how data augmentation and generative models can improve character recognition in damaged or incomplete texts.

### Notebook Overview
The notebooks present methodologies for the classification and generation of ancient Greek characters, employing machine learning techniques with an emphasis on synthetic data. Most parts of these notebooks were originally created by [Chahan Vidal-Gor√®ne](https://www.chartes.psl.eu/annuaire/chahan-vidal-gorene) during Python classes for the Digital Humanities students at the Ecole Nationale des Chartes. We have adapted them to work with our dataset.

## Character Inferences Notebook

### Overview
This notebook delves into character inferences, exploring techniques for predicting and understanding character properties based on given data. The primary objective is to classify Greek characters using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) framework.

### Key Points

1. **Data Preparation**
        - The dataset consists of images of Greek characters organized into subfolders by character.
        - Images are loaded and preprocessed using TensorFlow's image_dataset_from_directory method.

2. **Model Definition**
       - The YOLO (You Only Look Once) framework is employed for classifying character images.
       - The model leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately categorize images into designated classes.

3. **Training**
       - The model is trained using different parameters. 
            
       - The model's performance is assessed using an occlusion technique commonly used in computer vision.
        
4. **Results**

    The model achieved reasonable classification accuracy but faced challenges due to the complex nature of ancient script characters.
    The generated heatmaps provided insights into the discriminative features used by the model for character classification.
    Future work should focus on refining the model architecture and exploring larger datasets to improve classification performance.
