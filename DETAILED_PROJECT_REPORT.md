## Comprehensive Report on the Notebooks: "character_classification" and "greek_pagan"

### Introduction
The project is focused on employing machine learning techniques to identify and generate ancient Greek characters. It is structured around several key activities, including dataset preparation, model training, and evaluation of generative models. 
The overarching goal is to explore how data augmentation and generative models can improve character recognition in damaged or incomplete texts.

### Notebook Overview
The notebooks present methodologies for the classification, generation, and comparison of ancient Greek characters, employing machine learning techniques with an emphasis on synthetic data.
These notebooks were originally created by [Chahan Vidal-Gor√®ne](https://www.chartes.psl.eu/annuaire/chahan-vidal-gorene) during Python classes for the Digital Humanities students at the Ecole Nationale des Chartes. We have adapted them to load our dataset.

#### 1. "character_classification.md"

This notebook outlines a project centered on the detection and recognition of ancient Greek characters using the YOLO object detection model. It is structured into three main sections:

**A) Data Generation and Classification**
   - **Objective**: Classify ancient Greek characters by generating separate classes for each character type (e.g., alpha, beta).
   - **Methodology**: Utilize the ICDAR dataset, enhance it to be compatible with YOLO, and set up a baseline for training.

**B) Dataset Analysis**
   - **ICDAR Dataset**: Used for initial training and model benchmarking.
   - **GAN Dataset**: Exploring the potential of generating synthetic characters to improve data diversity and model robustness.

**C) Application and Experimentation**
   - **Utilization**: Applying techniques from previous coursework to generate Greek numeric characters.
   - **Question**: Investigate whether data generation can yield better results when existing datasets are limited.

**Task Division and Collaboration**
   - **Sub-projects**: Classification, Generation, and Improvement.
   - **Data Augmentation**: Discussions focus on the theoretical and practical benefits of creating synthetic datasets to enhance model performance.

#### 2. "greek_pagan.md"

This notebook details the process required to set up a working environment for executing the "python_travail" notebook and further scripts.

### Methods and Tools

- **Conda**: Used for environment management to ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed and isolated.
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: A real-time object detection system applied to classify individual characters from images.
- **GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)**: Investigated for its potential to artificially enhance the training dataset by generating synthetic character images.

### Findings and Recommendations
The project emphasizes the importance of data quality and quantity in training robust machine learning models. 
Preliminary findings suggest that augmenting datasets with synthetic data could potentially bridge gaps in existing datasets, especially when dealing with historical texts that are often incomplete or damaged.

**Recommendations**:
- **Further Investigation**: More rigorous testing and evaluation are recommended to quantify the impact of synthetic data on overall model accuracy and reliability.

### Conclusion
The notebooks present a comprehensive approach to handling, analyzing, and enhancing datasets for ancient Greek character recognition using advanced machine learning techniques.
Continued exploration and development in these areas are crucial for achieving significant improvements in historical text analysis and recognition technologies.
