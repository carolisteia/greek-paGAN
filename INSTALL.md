# Installation Guide

Welcome to the installation guide for our project. This guide will walk you through the setup process for two crucial components necessary for running our applications: **TensorFlow with GPU support** and **Yolo V8**. By following these steps, you will prepare your environment to leverage TensorFlow's powerful machine learning capabilities with GPU acceleration and deploy Yolo V8 for advanced object detection tasks.

We have provided detailed instructions to ensure compatibility and ease of installation. 

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure your system meets the following requirements:
- Python (We use the latest 3.10 version)
- A CUDA-capable GPU for TensorFlow (optional but recommended for TensorFlow GPU support)

## Contents
1. [TensorFlow with GPU Support](#tensorflow-with-gpu-support)
2. [Yolo V8 Installation](#yolo-v8)

By the end of this guide, you will have a fully functional environment ready for developing and testing applications using TensorFlow and Yolo V8. Let's get started!
